# DO Freelancer-ASP.NET MVC
------------------------
Public releases, this website project has not reached the alpha version yet.

this is my university project for studying ASP.NET MVC AT IITU. I decided to continue working on this and improve my knowledge in some specific areas during the development process. 
Since there are many things to tweak and change, I want to update scripts and documentation before release. 
This web project will not be put up for sale or sold. At the moment, you can download the project for free with fair use rights. The UI design has been completely redesigned by looking at bootstrap examples.

In this project, I am using MVC(Model-Controller View) architecture design patterns also I am working with .Net Visual Studio IDE.
An Freelancer hosted on localhost and written with the following frameworks (all of those frameworks can be found in use in the project itself):
